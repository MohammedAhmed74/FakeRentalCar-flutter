    'title': 'MERCEDES EQC',
    'price': 5573,
    'description':'Mercedes’ first all-electric vehicle has an 80kWh battery powering two individual motors - one at each axle. The total power output is 403bhp which, along with the strong 760Nm of torque, enables the EQC to travel from 0-62mph in 5.1 seconds. Maximum speed is 112mph, which is about the current average for electric cars and helps to preserve battery charge and range. During our own test of the EQC we managed the 0-62mph sprint in 5.2 seconds, but the more significant figures for real-world driving are the impressive 1.5 seconds it took to get from 30 to 50mph and 2.9 seconds from 50 to 70mph. In real world driving, it feels genuinely fast.'

        'The 2022 BMW 8-series coupe and convertible are positioned as the most extravagant two-door models in the company\'s portfolio. With aggressive proportions and sinewy sheetmetal, both body styles have notable curbside presence, even if neither is as fancy as, say, the Lexus LC. Still, BMW endows each with a beautiful interior that is exquisitely appointed and impeccably built. While its tiny back seat exists as a courtesy, anyone who needs more passenger space can opt for the 8-series Gran Coupe sedan (reviewed separately). Power comes from two excellent sources: a 335-hp turbocharged straight-six (840i) or a 523-hp twin-turbo V-8 (M850i). Regardless of the powertrain, the 2022 8-series coupe and convertible have surprising agility for their size and a genuinely serene ride quality.'

    'description':
        'In an amazing twist of fate, General Motors\' gas-guzzling Hummer brand, discontinued in 2010, is poised to make a comeback for 2022 as an all-electric sub-brand of GMC. The resurrected Hummer will appear first as a pickup truck and later as an SUV. The new pickup is shaping up to be quite the beast, with up to 1000 horsepower from its top powertrain option, which uses three electric motors, offers an estimated range of 350 miles per charge, and a leaps to 60 mph in a claimed 3.0 seconds. The Hummer EV also features removable roof panels, an optional adjustable air suspension, and a cool four-wheel steering feature that allows it to \"crab\" sideways—drive diagonally—all of which should make it fun to take off-road. Pickup trucks are the next frontier for electric vehicles, as potential rivals from upstarts Rivian, Bollinger, and Tesla—as well as established automakers such as Ford—are preparing their own entries in this emerging segment. The Hummer EV appeared alongside comedians Awkwafina, Kenan Thompson, and Will Ferrell in a Super Bowl commercial in February 2021.'

    'title': 'Ford Mustang Shelby GT500',
    'price': 9440,
    'description':'The 2021 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 boasts 760 horses of supercharged-V-8 mayhem, but it also possesses the athleticism of smaller and lighter sports cars. Those accolades make it the most powerful production car Ford has ever built as well as the most immersive Mustang we\'ve ever driven, which is why it\'s on our Editors\' Choice list. At the center of the excitement is the Shelby\'s supercharged 5.2-liter V-8, which plays a thrilling soundtrack through its bazooka-like exhaust pipes. A manual transmission isn\'t available, but the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic operates damn near telepathically. The rear-drive-only coupe also accelerates so tenaciously that it should include a warranty on underwear. The GT500 feels equally thrilling when running down more exotic metal on a racetrack. Sure, it has terrible fuel economy and costs a lot for a Mustang–especially with the exorbitantly priced Carbon Fiber Track package–but the 2021 Shelby GT500 is a magnificent muscle car and a phenomenal sports car'
